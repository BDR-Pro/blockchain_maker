# Rust Blockchain Maker Package üöÄ

Welcome to the Rust Blockchain Maker Package! This is your ultimate toolkit for building, validating, and managing a blockchain in Rust. Below, you'll find everything you need to know to integrate and leverage our blockchain functionality in your Rust projects.

## Dependencies üì¶

Before diving into the blockchain wonders, make sure to include the following dependencies in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
chrono = "0.4"
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
sha2 = "0.10"
openssl = "0.10"
serde_json = "1.0"
```

These dependencies will ensure proper handling of time, serialization, cryptographic functions, and JSON formatting.

## Getting Started üåü

Import the necessary modules from our package and standard Rust libraries to start crafting your blockchain:

```rust
use blockchain_maker::Blockchain; // Our primary Blockchain structure.
//instead of all of this
use chrono::prelude::*; // For handling timestamps.
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize}; // For data serialization.
use sha2::{Sha256, Digest}; // For creating cryptographic hashes.
use openssl::ec::{EcGroup, EcKey}; // For elliptic curve cryptography.
```

## Core Functionalities üõ†

Our package provides a variety of functions to support your blockchain adventures:

### `get_block_hash_from_file(path: P) -> Result<String, Box<dyn std::error::Error>>`

Retrieves the hash of a blockchain block from a specified file.

- **Parameters**: `path: P` - A reference to the file path containing the block.
- **Returns**: A `Result` containing the block hash as a `String` if successful.

### `count_files_in_folder(path: P) -> std::io::Result<usize>`

Counts the files in a specified directory, aiding in block management.

- **Parameters**: `path: P` - A reference to the directory path.
- **Returns**: A `Result` with the count of files.

### `sign(message: &str, reward: u64, block_number: u64) -> (Vec<u8>, Vec<u8>)`

Generates a digital signature for a given message using ECDSA.

- **Parameters**

    1- `message: &str` - The message to sign.

    2- `reward: u64` - The mining reward.

    3- `block_number: u64` - The number of the block.
- **Returns**: A tuple containing the signature and public key.

## Structures üèó

Our primary structures include `Block` and `Blockchain`, designed to encapsulate all necessary blockchain data and functionalities:

### `Block`

Represents a single block in the blockchain, containing attributes like `timestamp, data, previous_hash, etc.`

### `Blockchain`

Manages the chain of blocks, providing methods for adding `new blocks, validating the chain, and calculating rewards.`

## Usage Example üìù

Here's how you can utilize our package to create and manage a blockchain:

```rust
use blockchain_maker::Blockchain;
use blockchain_maker::count_files_in_folder;

fn main() {
    // Attempt to load the blockchain from disk
    let mut blockchain: Blockchain = match Blockchain::load_chain_from_disk("my_blocks".to_string()) {
        Ok(chain) => chain,
        Err(e) => {
            // Handle the error e.g., by logging or creating a new, empty blockchain
            println!("Failed to load chain from disk, error: {}", e);
            // Potentially initialize a new, empty blockchain here if desired
            Blockchain::new() // This assumes you have a `new` method to create an empty blockchain
        },
    };

    // Validate the loaded or new blockchain
    if blockchain.validate_chain("my_blocks".to_string()) {
        println!("Blockchain validated successfully.");
    } else {
        println!("Blockchain validation failed.");
    }

    // Add new blocks to the blockchain
    if let Err(e) = blockchain.add_block("Block 1 Transactions Data".to_string()) {
        println!("Failed to add block: {}", e);
    }

    if let Err(e) = blockchain.add_block("Block 2 Transactions Data".to_string()) {
        println!("Failed to add block: {}", e);
    }

    // Print out the current state of the blockchain or other relevant information
    // This might involve iterating over the blocks and printing them out, 
    // or simply printing out the number of blocks in the chain
    println!("Current blockchain size: {}", count_files_in_folder("my_blocks".to_string()).unwrap());
}

```

This example demonstrates loading a blockchain from disk, validating it, adding new blocks, and displaying the blockchain size.

## Update 1.1.0 üöÄ

Now you can chooes initial reward for the first block in the blockchain.
plus when the halving will happen.

```rust
    pub struct Blockchain {
    chain: Vec<Block>,
    get_reward: u64,
    get_halving_interval: u64,
}
```
