# Rust Blockchain Maker Package üöÄ

Welcome to the Rust Blockchain Maker Package! This is your ultimate toolkit for building, validating, and managing a blockchain in Rust. Below, you'll find everything you need to know to integrate and leverage our blockchain functionality in your Rust projects.

## Dependencies üì¶

Before diving into the blockchain wonders, make sure to include the following dependencies in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
chrono = "0.4"
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
sha2 = "0.10"
openssl = "0.10"
serde_json = "1.0"
```

These dependencies will ensure proper handling of time, serialization, cryptographic functions, and JSON formatting.

## Getting Started üåü

Import the necessary modules from our package and standard Rust libraries to start crafting your blockchain:

```rust
use blockchain_maker::Blockchain; // Our primary Blockchain structure.
//instead of all of this
use chrono::prelude::*; // For handling timestamps.
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize}; // For data serialization.
use sha2::{Sha256, Digest}; // For creating cryptographic hashes.
use openssl::ec::{EcGroup, EcKey}; // For elliptic curve cryptography.
```

## Core Functionalities üõ†

Our package provides a variety of functions to support your blockchain adventures:

### `get_block_hash_from_file(path: P) -> Result<String, Box<dyn std::error::Error>>`

Retrieves the hash of a blockchain block from a specified file.

- **Parameters**: `path: P` - A reference to the file path containing the block.
- **Returns**: A `Result` containing the block hash as a `String` if successful.

### `count_files_in_folder(path: P) -> std::io::Result<usize>`

Counts the files in a specified directory, aiding in block management.

- **Parameters**: `path: P` - A reference to the directory path.
- **Returns**: A `Result` with the count of files.

### `sign(message: &str, reward: u64, block_number: u64) -> (Vec<u8>, Vec<u8>)`

Generates a digital signature for a given message using ECDSA.

- **Parameters**: 
    - `message: &str` - The message to sign.
    - `reward: u64` - The mining reward.
    - `block_number: u64` - The number of the block.
- **Returns**: A tuple containing the signature and public key.

## Structures üèó

Our primary structures include `Block` and `Blockchain`, designed to encapsulate all necessary blockchain data and functionalities:

### `Block`

Represents a single block in the blockchain, containing attributes like `timestamp, data, previous_hash, etc.`

### `Blockchain`

Manages the chain of blocks, providing methods for adding `new blocks, validating the chain, and calculating rewards.`

## Usage Example üìù

Here's how you can utilize our package to create and manage a blockchain:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut blockchain: Blockchain = Blockchain::new();

    // Load the blockchain from disk (if available)
    match Blockchain::load_chain_from_disk("my_blocks".to_string()) {
        Ok(chain) => blockchain = chain,
        Err(e) => println!("Failed to load chain from disk: {}", e),
    };

    // Validate the blockchain
    if blockchain.validate_chain("my_blocks".to_string()) {
        println!("Blockchain validated successfully.");
    } else {
        println!("Blockchain validation failed.");
    }

    // Add new blocks
    blockchain.add_block("Block 1 Transactions Data".to_string()).expect("Failed to add block");
    blockchain.add_block("Block 2 Transactions Data".to_string()).expect("Failed to add block");

    // Print the current size of the blockchain
    println!("Current blockchain size: {}", blockchain.chain.len());
}
```

This example demonstrates loading a blockchain from disk, validating it, adding new blocks, and displaying the blockchain size.
